An economist and attorney by profession, Kabbah spent many years working for the United Nations Development Programme. He retired from the United Nations and returned to Sierra Leone in 1992.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn early 1996, Kabbah was elected leader of the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP) and was the party\u0027s presidential candidate in the country\u0027s first free presidential election later that year. He was elected with 59% of the vote, defeating his closest rival, John Karefa-Smart of the United National People\u0027s Party (UNPP), who had 40% in the runoff vote and conceded defeat. International observers declared the election free and fair. Kabbah campaigned on a promise to end the civil war if elected president. During his inauguration speech as president, Kabbah repeated he promised to end the civil war, which he indeed achieved later in his presidency.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA deeply devoted Muslim, Kabbah was born in Pendembu, Kailahun District in Eastern Sierra Leone, though he was raised in the capital Freetown. Kabbah was an ethnic Mandingo. Kabbah was Sierra Leone\u0027s first and currently the only Muslim head of state of the country.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKabbah\u0027s first marriage, in 1965, was to Patricia Tucker, a devout Christian from the Sherbro ethnic group and a native of Bonthe District in Southern Sierra Leone. He and Patricia Kabbah had five children. The two were often seen together in public before his presidency. She was very influential during his presidency, focusing mainly on humanitarian issues, and was outspoken on the need to end the civil war.

The rebels however continued their attempt to overthrow Kabbah\u0027s government, despite signing numerous peace accords with President Kabbah. In May 2000, Foday Saybanah Sankoh, who was then part of Kabbah\u0027s cabinet, kidnapped several UN troops, and then ordered his rebels to march to Freetown. Trouble was looming as the capital was once more threatened with another January 6, 1999, scenario.

The African Union special forces sent to Sierra Leone to assist the government in fighting the rebels were made up mainly of soldiers from Nigeria, Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Zambia and The Gambia. The international forces, led by the British troops, launched a number of successful military operations to repel the RUF rebels and retake many of the areas of the country that were under the rebel control.

Johnny Paul Koroma (9 May 1960 \u2013 1 June 2003\/11 August 2017) was the head of state of Sierra Leone from May 1997 to February 1998.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EYouth and education\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoroma was born to Limba parents in Tombodu, in the Kono District of eastern British Sierra Leone, and grew up in Freetown, the capital. He is from the same ethnic group as former presidents Siaka Stevens and Joseph Saidu Momoh.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe joined the Sierra Leonean army in 1985 and was sent to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England in 1988 to train as an officer. He returned to Sierra Leone the next year and was promoted to platoon commander, and soon thereafter to company commander. He continued to move up the ladder, and in 1994, he went to the Teshi Military College in Ghana for training in army command.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ECoups and civil war\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoroma received military training in Nigeria and United Kingdom. He commanded government forces who were fighting against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), a rebel army led by the warlord Foday Sankoh. In August 1996, he was arrested for alleged involvement in a coup plot against the southern civilian officials who were in control of the country. It was also alleged that there were plans to kill President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoroma was freed from prison during a successful military coup on 25 May 1997, when 17 junior soldiers serving the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) broke into the central prison and made a do-or-die offer that brought him to power.[clarification needed] He advocated making a peaceful settlement with Sankoh and allowing him to join the government, though this never happened.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the coup in 1997, Koroma was named head of state and chairman of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). He invited the leadership of the Revolutionary United Front to join the AFRC, which they promptly did. To maintain order, he suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations and abolished all political parties.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe AFRC coup was accompanied by an explosion of violence against civilians throughout the nation. The key strategic change was that the RUF had immediate access throughout the country, something they had failed to achieve through six years of military action. Koroma cited corruption, erosion of state sovereignty, over-dependence on foreign nations, and leaders\u0027 failure to address tensions between the SLA and government-backed tribal militia movements (in particular the Kamajors) as the pretext for the coup.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoroma\u0027s story was consistent with that of the AFRC, which cited the failure of the Abidjan Peace Accord struck between the government of Sierra Leone and the RUF on 30 November 1996.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EInvolvement of ECOMOG\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2 June 1997, the RUF\/AFRC found itself at odds with Nigerian forces, which were deployed unilaterally under the Economic Community of West African States\u0027 Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and its mandate of August 1997. The Nigerians were stationed in and around Freetown\u0027s Western Area, trading mortar fire along the main highway into Freetown and around Freetown International Airport.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKoroma immediately sought to ease the situation, seeking mediation, which resulted in the signing of a peace accord in late October 1997 in Conakry, Guinea. Almost immediately, violations of the peace accord were perpetrated by all sides in the complex conflict. By January 1998, ECOMOG forces were preparing to oust the RUF\/AFRC from power.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn 6 February 1998, ECOMOG forces invaded key locations in the Western Area, removing the RUF\/AFRC entirely by 12 February. On 1 March, ECOMOG forces commenced operations in provincial Sierra Leone, removing the RUF\/AFRC from every key town except Kailahun (in the far east of the country). By December 1998, RUF\/AFRC forces had reversed this position, and they entered Freetown in January 1999. Failing to hold territory, the RUF\/AFRC retreated into the Northern Province of Sierra Leone.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ELom\u00e9 Peace Agreement\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe leadership of the RUF oversaw negotiations with the government of Sierra Leone that led to the signing of the Lom\u00e9 Peace Accord on 7 July 1999. Koroma was cut out of the negotiations, and the AFRC did not benefit from the substantive provisions of the agreement. Nevertheless, Koroma participated in the disarmament process, encouraging those SLA soldiers who had joined the AFRC to demobilize.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2000, Koroma no longer held significant influence over the RUF leadership, as evidenced by the involvement of ex-AFRC members (from a splinter group called the West Side Boys) in defending towns in Port Loko District against a renewed RUF offensive in May 2000. In August 2000, Koroma officially disbanded the AFRC and sought to consolidate his position by forming a political party.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ESpecial Court for Sierra Leone\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn early 2002, the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations signed a bilateral treaty establishing the Special Court for Sierra Leone, mandated to try those who \u0022bear the greatest responsibility\u0022 for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. According to the indictment, the RUF\/AFRC, under the orders of Koroma, had led armed attacks in Sierra Leone in which the primary targets included civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and UN peacekeeping forces.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese attacks served the purpose of terrorizing the population as a form of punishment for not supporting rebel activities. They included such crimes as looting, murder, mutilations, sexual violence, and rape. Child soldiers were conscripted, and women and girls were kidnapped to be raped or turned into sex slaves. Men and boys were also abducted and forced to work or fight for the rebel groups.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn 7 March 2003, the prosecutor of the Special Court issued his first indictments. For his role in the RUF\/AFRC, Koroma was among them. He fled Freetown in December, reportedly to Liberia. On 1 June 2003, he was officially declared dead under mysterious circumstances, said to have been murdered. However, the prosecutor has yet to withdraw the indictment against Koroma. An October 2006 newspaper headline in Freetown read, \u0022Johnny Paul has 1,000 armed soldiers\u0022.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to an unconfirmed report in September 2008, Koroma\u0027s remains were found buried in Foya, a village in Liberia\u0027s Lofa County. However, Stephen Rapp, the Special Court\u0027s prosecutor, noted that DNA tests on the remains found in Lofa County did not match Koroma\u0027s DNA. As of 2010, many still believe Koroma was executed somewhere in Lofa at the hands of former President Charles Taylor of Liberia.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThree witnesses\u2014former Vice President Moses Blah of Liberia; Joseph Zig Zag Marzah, a former member of Taylor\u2019s National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) rebel group; and a protected witness\u2014testified that while they had not witnessed Koroma\u0027s execution, Taylor had told them about it. In October 2010, Taylor\u0027s defense team filed a motion to have these testimonies removed as evidence, alleging that the prosecution had bribed the three witnesses, but this motion was rejected the following month.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EApparently Koroma in the end only died on 10 or 11 August 2017 in his home village Binkolo.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","field_team_image":"\/sites\/default\/files\/2023-04\/johnny-paul-koroma.jpg"},{"nid":"335","uuid":"e8d89776-baaf-48fc-9487-6b1d07e3f2ee","field_team_name":"Sheka Sillah

Zainab Hawa Bangura\u003C\/strong\u003E (born 18 December 1959) is a Sierra Leonean politician and social activist who has been serving as the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) since 2018, appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. She served as the second United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict with the rank of Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations from 2012 to 2017, in succession to the first holder of the post, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m. In 2017 she was succeeded by Pramila Patten.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007, Bangura became Sierra Leone\u0027s foreign minister in the government of President Ernest Bai Koroma of the All People\u0027s Congress (APC) Party. She was the second woman to serve in that post, following Shirley Gbujama who held that position from 1996 to 1997. She served as Minister of Health and Sanitation from 2010 to 2012.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EEarly life\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe daughter of an imam, Zainab Hawa Bangura was born \u0022Zainab Hawa Sesay\u0022 in the small rural town of Yonibana, Tonkolili District in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone.[citation needed] She hails from the Temne ethnic group. She was born into a family of limited means, and she attended secondary school on a scholarship that was awarded to her by the Mathora Girls Secondary School near Magburaka. She later attended the Annie Walsh Girls Secondary School in the capital city of Freetown.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, after graduating from Sierra Leone\u0027s Fourah Bay College, Bangura moved to the United Kingdom for advanced diplomas in Insurance Management at the City University Business School of London and the University of Nottingham. While in her early 30s, she became vice-president of one of her country\u0027s largest insurance companies.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBangura speaks three languages: Temne, Krio, and English.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EPublic life\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Ch6\u003EEarly activism\u003C\/h6\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBangura became a social activist during the difficult period when Sierra Leone was ruled by the NPRC military junta. She began with consciousness-raising efforts among urban market women, reminding her followers that her own mother was a market woman. In 1994 she founded Women Organized for a Morally Enlightened Nation (W.O.M.E.N.), the first non-partisan women\u0027s rights group in the country. The following year she co-founded the Campaign for Good Governance (CGG). Then, using CGG as her platform, she campaigned for the holding of national elections that finally drove the NPRC from power in 1996 and restored democratic government. This was Sierra Leone\u0027s first democratic election in 25 years, and the Sierra Leonean media and the general public attributed that success largely to her efforts.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring Sierra Leone\u0027s civil war (1991\u20132002) Bangura spoke out forcefully against the atrocities committed against the civilian population by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and was targeted for assassination several times by that group. She also spoke against the corruption in the civilian government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the atrocities committed against civilians by government soldiers. In June 1997, as fighting engulfed the country, Bangura fled on a fishing boat to neighboring Guinea.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch6\u003EPolitical career\u003C\/h6\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 2002 elections, Bangura ran against Kabbah for the presidency of Sierra Leone, departing for the first time from her accustomed role as a non-partisan civil society activist. She won less than one percent of the vote, and her Movement for Progress (MOP) party failed to gain any seats in Sierra Leone\u0027s parliament. Bangura claimed that her party\u0027s low vote count resulted from corruption in the voting system.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the 2002 elections Bangura founded the National Accountability Group (NAG) whose mission was to fight against official corruption and to promote transparency and accountability in government. In 2006 she left Sierra Leone for neighbouring Liberia where she was appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Office in the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and given responsibility for the reconstruction of 16 Liberian ministries and 30 government agencies following that country\u0027s devastating civil war.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBangura returned to Sierra Leone in 2007 after Ernest Bai Koroma won the presidency in a hard-fought national election and was named foreign minister shortly thereafter. At the time, many Sierra Leoneans believed that the new president elevated this well known critic of government to such a high position to demonstrate his good faith in promising reform.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a devoted Muslim, Bangura took time off politics in 2009 to travel to the Holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to participate in the 2009 Hajj pilgrimage ceremony.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch6\u003ECareer in international politics\u003C\/h6\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012, Bangura served on the United Nations Commission on Life-Saving Commodities, which was jointly chaired by Goodluck Jonathan and Jens Stoltenberg, and issued recommendations to increase access to and use of 13 essential commodities for women\u2019s and children\u2019s health.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBangura subsequently assumed her next position as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict at the level of Under-Secretary-General on 4 September 2012. In this capacity, she also chaired the interagency network UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict. During her time in office, she helped launch an international protocol in 2014 for dealing with rape and sexual violence in conflict, providing guidelines on the investigation of sex crimes and the collection of evidence for future prosecutions.[13] She notably negotiated a June 2015 deal with military commanders in Ivory Coast to prosecute soldiers accused of sexual violence.[14] That same year, she visited Iraq and Syria and worked on an action plan to address the sexual violence being waged by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) fighters.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom 2018 until 2019, Bangura co-chaired (alongside Katherine Sierra) an Independent Commission on Sexual Misconduct, Accountability and Culture Change at Oxfam. In 2019, Guterres appointed her as Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi, succeeding Maimunah Mohd Sharif.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","field_team_image":"\/sites\/default\/files\/2023-04\/zainab-hawa-bangura.jpg"},{"nid":"339","uuid":"29f743a0-b610-4da3-a1f2-b418d4d03cd6","field_team_name":"Daniel Tholley","field_candidate_first_name":"Daniel","field_candidate_other_names":"","field_candidate_surname":"Tholley","field_election_political_party":"NGC","field_election_result_district":"Bombali","field_city_council":"","field_result_locality":"","field_result_constituency":"Constituency 33","field_election_result_ward":"","field_election_type":"Parliamentary","field_election_year":"2018","body":"","field_team_image":"\/sites\/default\/files\/default_images\/sloedp-ai-generated-male-profile-photo-2.png"},{"nid":"403","uuid":"53e9ba89-f4d8-4232-8f3f-460299ad2fa1","field_team_name":"Ibrahim Kabia","field_candidate_first_name":"Ibrahim","field_candidate_other_names":"","field_candidate_surname":"Kabia","field_election_political_party":"NGC","field_election_result_district":"Bombali","field_city_council":"","field_result_locality":"","field_result_constituency":"Constituency 36","field_election_result_ward":"","field_election_type":"Parliamentary","field_election_year":"2018","body":"","field_team_image":"\/sites\/default\/files\/default_images\/sloedp-ai-generated-male-profile-photo-2.png"},{"nid":"424","uuid":"5c2da050-9da6-46d6-94fe-9e7577844ba5","field_team_name":"Richard A.
